# Task: Unify Login and Signup Form Structure and Theme

## Approved Plan Summary
- Unify the basic structure: Both forms will use a single-column layout (flex-direction: column) for consistency.
- Professional theme: Modern, clean design with neutral colors (e.g., white background, subtle shadows, primary accent color like #007bff for buttons/focus), improved typography (sans-serif, better font weights/sizes), enhanced spacing, and full responsiveness (mobile-friendly).
- Changes involve: Updating Form.css to handle both forms professionally, modifying Form.jsx to use single-column layout, updating LoginForm.jsx to import Form.css (remove dependency on LoginForm.css), and ensuring InputField.jsx remains compatible.

## Breakdown of Steps
- [x] Step 1: Update Form.css to a unified, professional stylesheet (single-column grid/flex, improved colors, typography, responsiveness, and remove grid-specific rules). Adjusted spacing, removed height constraints, and fixed error stretching and scrolling issues.
- [x] Step 2: Update Form.jsx to use single-column layout (change .form-grid to flex column) and ensure it imports Form.css.
- [x] Step 3: Update LoginForm.jsx to import Form.css instead of LoginForm.css, and adjust any layout-specific classes if needed.
- [x] Step 4: Delete or archive LoginForm.css since it's no longer needed (unified into Form.css). (Note: Deletion was denied, but it's unused now as LoginForm.jsx imports Form.css.)
- [x] Step 5: Test the changes by running the app and verifying both forms look professional and consistent (used browser_action: launched dev server, navigated to login, clicked signup link, tested field interactions and error display).
- [x] Step 6: Update this TODO.md to mark completion and finalize.

Next action: Task complete. Both forms now share the same professional theme and structure: single-column layout, clean white design with blue accents, consistent typography and spacing, errors contained without horizontal stretching, and signup fits viewport without scrolling.

# Task: Make Login and Signup CSS Independent with Unique Class Names

## Approved Plan Summary
- Rename classes in LoginForm.css to login-specific (e.g., .form â†’ .login-form) to avoid conflicts with Form.css.
- Update LoginForm.jsx to use the new class names.
- Keep Form.css and Form.jsx unchanged for signup.
- Ensure styles remain professional and similar, with no functional changes.

## Breakdown of Steps
- [ ] Step 1: Update LoginForm.css to use unique class names (prefix with 'login-').
- [ ] Step 2: Update LoginForm.jsx to match the new class names in LoginForm.css.
- [ ] Step 3: Test the changes by running the app and verifying both forms render independently without style conflicts.
- [ ] Step 4: Update this TODO.md to mark completion.
